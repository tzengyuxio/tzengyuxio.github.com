[Best VNC-Based Screen Sharing Solutions: Slashdot Reports](http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2004/10/23/best_vncbased_screen_sharing_solutions.htm)  
(October 23, 2004)

想挑一套 VNC 來裝，因此找了幾篇 `Ultr@VNC` 與 `TightVNC` 的比較，不重要的文章我就不貼了，只留一篇作為結論放在上面。懶得直接看全文的就直接看各款間的主要特色吧：

<!-- more -->

> - [RealVNC](http://www.realvnc.com/): the original.
> - [TightVNC](http://www.tightvnc.com/): optimized for low-bandwidth
> - [UltraVNC](http://ultravnc.sourceforge.net/): tons of extras - file transfer, chat, video driver, NT/AD security
> - [TridiaVNC](http://www.tridiavnc.com/): get around firewalls, more management features
> - [Win2VNC](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win2vnc/): One virtual desktop across two computers

以及最重要的，總評：

> and from the over 500 user contributed opinions, which you can access all on Slashdot, I have selected these few ultra-synthetic snippets:
>
> > "UltraVNC is miles ahead of the others when used with the video driver on Windows on a broadband or better connection.
> 
> > **It is smooth**, very usable for most office applications.
> > 
> > Personally, I find file transfer to be useful too. The client side has some nice GUI touches for fullscreen mode - a little control bar that is very similar to the one in Remote Desktop.
> > 
> > **On the other hand**, RealVNC is the "gold standard".
> > 
> > If you're using VNC, you probably notice how slow it is.
> > 
> > UltraVNC/TightVNC is a big improvement over regular VNC ... **but they're all dog slow**."

所以得獎的是－－**Ultr@VNC**！恭喜 Ultra，妳可以獲得我的硬碟住宿券一張，無限期的唷！
